INSTALLATION

	To install copy "tinwhistletablature.js" to your MuseScore Plugin
	directory.  Next, download the font file from the URL above and
	install it into your Windows/fonts directory.

Obvious tweaks:

	The most obvious thing you may want to modify is the "font size".
	This is near line 60 in my version.

		font = new QFont("Tin Whistle Tab", 60);

	Change the 60 to a size that pleases you.  You will want to make
	adjustments to the Staff-System and possibly Staff spacing values to
	accommodate the font.
